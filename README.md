# Econometric-Forecasting

This is an academic report predicting mortgage delinquency rates using an auto-regressive distributed-lag model. The report is saved as final_draft.pdf. The research was performed in Stata using the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database. Support work is included as .do files. 

This paper proposes a model for predicting mortgage delinquency rates in the United States for the periods 2019 quarter 3, 2019 quarter 4, 2020 quarter 1, and 2020 quarter 2. The forecast is based off of the data series titled: Delinquency Rate on Single-Family Residential Mortgages, Booked in Domestic Offices, All Commercial Banks (Delinquency Rate(2019)). The data series examines the number of delinquent residential mortgage loans as a percentage of all residential mortgage loans booked in U.S. commercial banks. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system qualifies a delinquent loan as one that is outstanding and no longer accruing interest or one that is past due by thirty days or more and still accruing interest. This paper finds that mortgage delinquency rates will rise in 2019 quarter 3, 2019 quarter 4, and 2020 quarter 1, and fall slightly in 2020 quarter 2.
